Date: 2023-10-15

Attendees:
- Sarah (Project Manager)
- David (Solutions Architect)
- Emma (Developer Lead)
- Michael (Database Administrator)
- Jessica (DevOps Engineer)

Project Requirements:
1. Migrate our current e-commerce platform to AWS
2. Need to handle peak traffic of 10,000 concurrent users during holiday seasons
3. Database currently has 500GB of product data and 1TB of historical order data
4. Need high availability with 99.99% uptime
5. Must have disaster recovery capability with RPO of 1 hour and RTO of 4 hours
6. Compliance requirements include PCI DSS for payment processing
7. Analytics team needs access to sales data for business intelligence

Proposed Architecture Discussion:
- David suggested using Elastic Load Balancer for distributing traffic
- Need at least 4 EC2 instances for the web tier (t3.xlarge suggested)
- The application tier should have 4-6 instances for processing orders
- RDS with Multi-AZ for the main product database (MySQL)
- Consider Aurora for better performance
- S3 for storing product images and static assets
- SQS for order processing queue to handle traffic spikes
- CloudWatch for monitoring and alerts
- WAF for security compliance

Database Considerations:
- Michael emphasized the need for a read replica for reporting queries
- Database needs to support at least 1,000 transactions per second at peak
- We should consider using RDS MySQL db.r5.2xlarge for the primary database
- Need 1TB of storage initially with room to grow
- DynamoDB could be used for shopping cart and session management

Deployment Strategy:
- Jessica recommended a blue-green deployment approach
- CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline
- Infrastructure as Code using CloudFormation or Terraform
- Need to set up automatic scaling for handling traffic variations
- Consider multi-region for the future, but start with us-east-1

Next Steps:
- Emma will create proof of concept for the application tier
- Michael will plan the database migration strategy
- Jessica will draft the IaC templates
- Sarah will coordinate with the security team for compliance requirements
- Next meeting scheduled for October 22nd to review progress
